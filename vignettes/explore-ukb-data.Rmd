After downloading and decrypting your UK Biobank (UKB) data with the supplied UKB programs (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/UsingUKBData.pdf), you have multiple files that need to be brought together to give you a tidy dataset to explore. The data file has column names that are the field codes from the UKB data showcase. `ukbtools` provides tools to tidy up the naming of the variables and perform exploratory analysis. 

<br>
<br>


## 1. Preparing a UKB fileset

Download^ยง^ then decrypt your data and create a UKB fileset (.tab, .r, .html):

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ukb_unpack ukbxxxx.enc key
ukb_conv ukbxxxx.enc_ukb r
ukb_conv ukbxxxx.enc_ukb docs

```


`ukb_unpack` decrypts your downloaded `ukbxxxx.enc` file, outputting a `ukbxxxx.enc_ukb` file. `ukb_conv` with the `r` flag converts the decrypted data to a tab-delimited file `ukbxxxx.tab` and an R script `ukbxxxx.r` that reads the tab file. The `docs` flag creates an html file containing a field-code-to-description table (among others).

<br>

^ยง^ Full details of the data download and decrypt process are given in the _Using UK Biobank Data_ documentation (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/UsingUKBData.pdf).

<br>
<br>


## 2. Making a dataset

The function `ukb_df()` takes two arguments, the stem of your fileset and the path, and returns a dataframe with usable column names. 


```{r, eval = FALSE}

my_ukb_data <- ukb_df("ukbxxxx")

```


You can also specify the path to your fileset if it is not in the current directory. For example, if your fileset is in a subdirectory of the working directory called data


```{r, eval = FALSE}

my_ukb_data <- ukb_df("ukbxxxx", path = "./data/")

```


<br>

__Note:__ You can move the three files in your fileset after creating them with `ukb_conv`, but they should be kept together. `ukb_df()` automatically updates the read call in the R source file to point to the correct directory (the current directly by default, or the directory specified by `path`).

<br>
<br>

#### 2.1 Multiple downloads

If you have multiple UKB downloads, tidy then merge them.

```{r eval = FALSE}

ukbxxxx_data <- ukb_df("ukbxxxx", path = "./data/")
ukbyyyy_data <- ukb_df("ukbyyyy", path = "./data/")
ukbzzzz_data <- ukb_df("ukbzzzz", path = "./data/")

my_ukb_data <- plyr::join_all(
  list(
    ukbxxxx_data,
    ukbyyyy_data,
    ukbzzzz_data),
  by = "eid",
  type = "full")

```

<br>

__Note:__ You will have at least one variable duplicated in the different downloads, the unique individual identifier `eid`. Counting the repeated variables (and the number of repeats of each) can give you a sense of the expected number of variables in your merged dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

ukb_names <- c(
  names(ukbxxxx_data),
  names(ukbyyyy_data),
  names(ukbzzzz_data)
)
count_ukb_names <- data.frame(table(ukb_names))
dim(count_ukb_names[count_names$Freq > 1, ])

```

<br>
<br>


## 3. Retreiving ICD diagnoses


To retrieve the full diagnosis of an individual

```{r, eval = FALSE}

icd_diagnosis(my_ukb_data, id = "0000000", icd.version = 10)

```

<br>
<br>

To retrieve the "meaning" of an ICD code use `icd_code`. (You can also look up multiple codes by concatenating them.)

```{r, eval = FALSE}

icd_code(icd.code = "H282", icd.version = 10)

```

The full ICD "code-meaning" tables are available as datasets (`icd9codes`, `icd10codes`)

<br>
<br>

To see the disease "blocks" that correspond to "chapters" in ICD-9 or ICD-10, `icd_chapter` takes the relevant ICD revision (or version) number

```{r, eval = FALSE}

icd_chapter(icd.version = 10)

```

`icd_chapter` prints to screen the required table. These are also available for query as datasets (`icd9chapters`, `icd10chapters`)

<br>
<br>


## 4. Exploring a UKB sample subset

As an exploratory step you might want to look at the characteristics of a particular subset of the UKB sample relative to the full sample. For example, the subsample with your variable of interest. `ukb_context` plots the subset with data for your variable interest, against the full sample.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

ukb_context(my_ukb_data, comparison.var = )

```
